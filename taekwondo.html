    <p>Tae kwon do, Korean art of unarmed combat that is based on the earlier form of Korean self-defense known as tae kyon and on karate. The name tae kwon do was officially adopted for this martial art in 1955 after that name had been submitted by the South Korean general Choi Hong-Hi, the principal founder of tae kwon do.

        Tae kwon do is characterized by the extensive use of high standing and jump kicks as well as punches and is practiced for sport, self-defense, and spiritual development. Training in tae kwon do is carried out by learning individual techniques of kicking, punching, and blocking, which are practiced in combined series of techniques in traditional sets known as hyung. (Proficiency in the graded series of hyung determines rank in the lower grades.) Students also practice basic sparring combinations (id-bo tueryon, “one-step sparring”); these are short, set sequences of attack and counter practiced between partners, after which the students may practice free sparring as opponents. In sparring, blows are stopped just short of contact. Tae kwon do is practiced as a sport by awarding points to correctly executed techniques during free sparring or by judging the quality of performed hyung. Tae kwon do became an Olympic medal sport at the 2000 Sydney Games. See also martial art.
